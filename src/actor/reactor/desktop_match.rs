//! Matching the desktops a record remembers against the ones the window
//! server lists now.
//!
//! `display_record` answers "which desktop is which after a reconfiguration"
//! with six overlapping mechanisms — `seen`, `met`, `minted`, `stopgaps`,
//! `paired` and a substitution table — each keyed on `SpaceId` and each a
//! partial answer. They are partial because the thing they are keyed on does
//! not survive the question: macOS destroys desktops, mints new ones for a
//! return, and moves a space between displays as a matter of course. Two
//! recorded traces show a space changing display twenty and fifteen times
//! respectively; that is not corruption, it is what the identifier does.
//!
//! What does survive is the windows. A desktop holding Safari and three
//! TextEdits before a lid closed is the desktop holding Safari and three
//! TextEdits after it opens, whatever number the window server has given it in
//! between. So this matches on content, scores every candidate pairing, and
//! takes the best — one function, run again on each report until it converges,
//! in place of six mechanisms that each fire once and must fire at the right
//! moment.
//!
//! It is deliberately free of `Instant`, of the record, and of the reactor: it
//! takes two lists and returns a mapping, so it can be tested on the awkward
//! cases directly rather than by arranging for a display to be unplugged.
