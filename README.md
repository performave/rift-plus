<!-- - Drag windows over one another to swap positions -->
- Does **not** require disabling SIP
- Performant animations <sup>(as seen in the [demo](#rift))</sup>
- Switch to next/previous workspace with trackpad gestures <sup>(just like native macOS)</sup>
- Hot reloadable configuration
- Mach port based IPC for communicating with rift from <a href="https://acsandmann.github.io/rift-docs/ecosystem/plugins/">third-party programs</a> (sketchybar, etc)
- Works with “Displays have separate Spaces” enabled (unlike all other major WMs)

## This fork

`rift-plus` is a fork of [acsandmann/rift](https://github.com/acsandmann/rift)
carrying extra patches — most visibly, it ships its own scripting addition, so
moving windows between spaces works without yabai installed. Releases are
Developer ID signed and notarized.

```sh
brew install performave/tap/rift-plus
```

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what it adds over upstream.

## Support

If rift is part of your daily workflow, consider [sponsoring its development](https://github.com/sponsors/acsandmann).

## Motivation
Aerospace worked well for me, but I missed animations and the ability to use fullscreen on one display while working on the other. I also prefer leveraging private/undocumented APIs as they tend to be more reliable (due to the OS being built on them and all the public APIs) and performant.
<sup><sup>for more on why rift exists and what rift strives to do, see the [manifesto](manifesto.md)</sup></sup>


## Credits
Rift began as a fork (and is licensed as such) of <a href="https://github.com/glide-wm/glide">glide-wm</a> but has since diverged significantly. It uses private APIs reverse engineered by yabai and other projects. It is not affiliated with glide-wm or yabai.
